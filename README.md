# AI-Powered Vehicle Diagnostic & Service Automation System  
### (EY Techathon / EY Innovation Challenge Submission)

---

## Overview

This project is an end-to-end **AI-driven vehicle health monitoring, service automation, and vendor intelligence platform**, developed as part of an **EY technology/innovation submission**.

It not only handles vehicle diagnostics and automated service booking, but also includes a **global vendor rating and recommendation system** for enterprises to identify the best-performing service partners.

The platform connects **vehicles, service centers, vendors, and companies** into one intelligent ecosystem.

---

## Core Idea

The core idea is to convert **raw operational data into automated enterprise decisions**.

Instead of isolated systems, this platform unifies:

- AI-based fault prediction  
- Automated service execution  
- Vendor performance analytics  
- Global vendor intelligence  

All driven by AI and real-time data.

> **In short:**  
> **Machine Intelligence → Operational Automation → Enterprise Optimization**

## What the System Does

At a high level, the platform provides:

### Vehicle & Service Layer

- AI-based vehicle fault detection  
- Predictive maintenance insights  
- Automatic service decision making  
- Voice call automation to users  
- WhatsApp/SMS based booking  
- Service center recommendation  
- Centralized logging and monitoring  

### Vendor Intelligence Layer (Company Side)

## Why This Fits EY

This system aligns strongly with **EY’s focus areas**:

- Digital transformation  
- Intelligent automation  
- Enterprise AI platforms  
- Data-driven decision systems  

Unlike typical dashboard projects, this platform is:

- Autonomous  
- Predictive  
- AI-driven  
- Enterprise-scalable  
- Strategy-oriented  

---

## Final Vision

The long-term vision is to build a **global AI-powered service and vendor intelligence network** where:

- Vehicles self-diagnose  
- AI predicts failures  
- Services are booked automatically  
- Vendors are continuously evaluated  
- Companies get the best vendors globally  
- Decisions are optimized using real data  

This transforms operational data into **enterprise-level strategic intelligence**.
